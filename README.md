## Motivation
Entity Relationship diagrams(ER-diagrams) are typically used in computing to organize data within databases and information systems. These graphical representations of entities and their relationships to each other are particularly useful during the conceptual-design and review phases of databases. 

Often drag and drop software as to other programming languages are tedious to use, resulting in complex learning processes and time consumption. ERMaker is a high-level programing language developed as an alternative for drawing ER-diagrams. 


## Language Features
ERmaker will allow the user to draw, through a console, the following major components of an ER-diagram:
1. Rectangles divided into two parts: These will represent entity sets. The top part will represent the name of the entity set. The      bottom part will contain the names of the attributes corresponding to that particular entity set.
2. Small Rectangles: These will represent relationship sets.
3. Lines: link relationship sets to entity sets.
4. Mapping cardinality:The user will be able to specify if the cardinality is one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many.
5. Modality: State whether an entityâ€™s participation in a relationship is mandatory or optional.
