## Motivation
Entity Relationship diagrams(ER-diagrams) are typically used in computing to organize data within databases and information systems. These graphical representations of entities and their relationships to each other are particularly useful during the conceptual-design and review phases of databases. 

Often drag and drop software as to other programming languages are tedious to use, resulting in complex learning processes and time consumption. ERMaker is a high-level programing language developed as an alternative for drawing ER-diagrams.
